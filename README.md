# CoSE-pytorch

A Pytorch implemented solution based on the "Compositional Stroke Embeddings" paper presented at NeurlIPS 2020 (originally coded in Tensorflow). Link: https://paperswithcode.com/paper/cose-compositional-stroke-embeddings. This implementation aims to validate the results of this paper, and the results of this research were to be reported in the ML Reproducibility Challenge 2020.
